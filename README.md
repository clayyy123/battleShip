# Battleship
----
### About:
The Russians and the Americans are back at it again. With Drumpf's betrayal against Putin,  they have agreed on a final battleship royale to settle the dispute.
### Instructions:
This classic two-player board game requires the setup of different ships along a 10 x 10 grid and bombing them!  The physical copy of the game has numbers and letters along the x-y axis, so that the players can call which square they want to choose.  
Start:

1. Each player takes turn setting up their ships horizontally or verically on the battleship grid.
2. Once all the ships are placed, each player alternates choosing(bombing) a square hoping the enemy ship is located there.  
3. If a ship is hit, the player continues choosing.
4. If a ship is not hit, the next player starts their turn.  

### Technology Used:
 HTML and CSS were used to create and style the page. Javascript and JQuery were used to create user interaction. 

### Approach
-
#### User Stories
	*As a player, I want to rotate the boat. 
	*As a player, I want to know which ship I sank.
	*As a player, I want to hide the opposing players board.

#### Tackling the project
I was a little unorganized going forward with this project because I stopped using my Trello and created checkpoints I wanted to achieve as I went with the game.  My thought process in creating the game:

1. Hard coded the grid with divs on HTML and styled the divs through CSS.
2. Created the ships with divs which were later replaced with pictures of the ships.  
3. Created a rotating function to allow the players place their ships horizontally or vertically.
4. Linking the bomb grid to the opposing players ship grid.
5. Styling

### Challenges and Unsolved Problems
Biggest challenge was creating the rotating function because of the way the divs were created.  
Other challenges were CSS-related. 
One of the challenges I did not get to implement in my game was the pick-up and drop-off function.  Picking up the ship and seeing the picture get dragged around and dropping it to the current squares became a problem because I could not get the divs to hold the value of the boat.  
Another problem was the ship highlighting feature.  When the mouse leaves it makes the divs it was over the color I programmed it to be.  Meaning I could not use picture backgrounds.
